  PRIMARY VARIABLE

 
             WAGES - HOURLY RATE OF PAY FOR JOB 01
 
The hourly rate of pay as of either the job's stop date or the interview date 
for on-going jobs. If the job lasted 13 weeks or less this variable is 
calculated as of the job's start date.
 
COMMENT: although this calculation - which factors in the reported pay, rate of 
pay time unit, and hours worked - can produce extremely low or extremely high 
pay rates, these values are not edited.

NOTE This variable changed in 2020. For details, please see the errata entitled: 
 "Corrections from a review of CV_HRLY_COMPENSATION and CV_HRLY_PAY variables"

  PRIMARY VARIABLE

 
             AMOUNT OF PARENT/SPOUSE OTHER INCOME 1999
 
About how much did you both receive in total (pre-tax)?
Truncated values are applied to the top 2 percent of respondents with valid 
non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is used 
as the truncation level ($142,158 for this variable).  Values for all cases at 
or over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the 
top 2 percent of the cases.

  PRIMARY VARIABLE

 
             ASVAB MATH_VERBAL SCORE PERCENT
 
To calculate the ASVAB_MATH_VERBAL_SCORE_PCT, NLS Program staff first grouped 
respondents into three-month age groups.  That is, the oldest cohort included 
those born from January through March of 1980, while the youngest were born from
October through December 1984 (a total of 20 cohorts, with an average of about 
350 respondents per cohort).  Custom sampling weights (computed for the sample 
of 7,093 respondents who have scores on all four exams) were assigned for each 
respondent's scores.  Within each three-month age group and using the sampling 
weights, we assigned percentiles for the theta scores for the tests on 
Mathematical Knowledge (MK), Arithmetic Reasoning (AR), Word Knowledge (WK), and
Paragraph Comprehension (PC) based on the weighted number of respondents scoring
below each score.  We added the percentile scores for WK and PC to get an 
aggregate Verbal score (V) for which an aggregated intra-group, internally 
normed, percentile was then computed.  NLS Program staff then added the 
percentile scores for MK, AR and two times the aggregated percentile for V.  
Finally, within each group we computed a percentile score, using the weights, on
this aggregate score, yielding a final value between zero and 99.
 
COMMENT: USERS SHOULD NOTE THAT, ALTHOUGH THE FORMULA IS SIMILAR TO THE AFQT 
SCORE GENERATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FOR THE NLSY79 COHORT, THIS 
VARIABLE REFLECTS WORK DONE BY NLS PROGRAM STAFF AND IS NEITHER GENERATED NOR 
ENDORSED BY DOD.  FOR MORE DETAILS, USERS SHOULD READ THE NLSY97 USER'S GUIDE 
SECTION ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CAT-ASVAB, ASVAB_MATH_VERBAL SCORE_PCT.

Credit weighted overall GPA.  This variable indicates grade point averages 
across all courses on a 4 point grading scale. For each course, the quality 
grade (TRANS_CRS_GRADE.xxx) is weighted by Carnegie credits 
(TRANS_CRS_CARNEGIE_CREDIT.xxx). Quality grades were recoded as follows: 1 = 
4.3, 2=4.0, 3=3.7, 4=3.3, 5=3.0, 6=2.7, 7=2.3, 8=2.0, 9=1.7, 10=1.3, 11=1.0, 
12=0.7, 13=0.0, all other values recoded to missing.  Please see Appendix 11 of

             WAGES - HOURLY RATE OF PAY FOR JOB 01
 
The hourly rate of pay as of either the job's stop date or the interview date

pay time unit, and hours worked - can produce extremely low or extremely high 
pay rates, these values are not edited.

NOTE This variable changed in 2020. For details, please see the errata entitled:

  PRIMARY VARIABLE

 
             WAGES - HOURLY RATE OF PAY FOR JOB 01
 
The hourly rate of pay as of either the job's stop date or the interview date 
for on-going jobs. If the job lasted 13 weeks or less this variable is 
calculated as of the job's start date.
 
COMMENT: although this calculation - which factors in the reported pay, rate of 
pay time unit, and hours worked - can produce extremely low or extremely high 
pay rates, these values are not edited.

NOTE This variable changed in 2020. For details, please see the errata entitled: 
 "Corrections from a review of CV_HRLY_COMPENSATION and CV_HRLY_PAY variables"

  PRIMARY VARIABLE

 
             WAGES - HOURLY RATE OF PAY FOR JOB 01
 
The hourly rate of pay as of either the job's stop date or the interview date 
for on-going jobs. If the job lasted 13 weeks or less this variable is 
calculated as of the job's start date.
 
COMMENT: although this calculation - which factors in the reported pay, rate of 
pay time unit, and hours worked - can produce extremely low or extremely high 
pay rates, these values are not edited.

NOTE This variable changed in 2020. For details, please see the errata entitled: 
 "Corrections from a review of CV_HRLY_COMPENSATION and CV_HRLY_PAY variables"

pay time unit, and hours worked - can produce extremely low or extremely high 
pay rates, these values are not edited.

non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is used 
as the truncation level ($ 88,000 for this variable).  Values for all cases at 
or over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the 
top 2 percent of the cases.

  SECONDARY VARIABLE

 
             TOTAL INCOME FROM BUSINESS OR FARM IN PAST YEAR
 
During 2009, how much income did you receive from your own farm, business, 
partnership or professional practice AFTER EXPENSES?  (IF RESPONDENT LOST MONEY 
ON OWN FARM, BUSINESS, ETC. AFTER EXPENSES ENTER NEGATIVE VALUE)
 
UNIVERSE: R received income from farm/business/partnership/professional practice

Truncated values are applied to the top 2 percent of respondents with valid 
non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is used 
as the truncation level ($ 75,000 for this variable).  Values for all cases at 
or over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the 
top 2 percent of the cases.

  PRIMARY VARIABLE

 
             WAGES - HOURLY RATE OF PAY FOR JOB 01
 
The hourly rate of pay as of either the job's stop date or the interview date 
for on-going jobs. If the job lasted 13 weeks or less this variable is 
calculated as of the job's start date.
 
COMMENT: although this calculation - which factors in the reported pay, rate of 
pay time unit, and hours worked - can produce extremely low or extremely high 
pay rates, these values are not edited.

NOTE This variable changed in 2020. For details, please see the errata entitled: 
 "Corrections from a review of CV_HRLY_COMPENSATION and CV_HRLY_PAY variables" 

NOTE: 2 implied decimal places

  PRIMARY VARIABLE

 
             WAGES - HOURLY RATE OF PAY FOR JOB 01
 
The hourly rate of pay as of either the job's stop date or the interview date 
for on-going jobs. If the job lasted 26 weeks or less this variable is 
calculated as of the job's start date.
 
COMMENT: although this calculation - which factors in the reported pay, rate of 
pay time unit, and hours worked - can produce extremely low or extremely high 
pay rates, these values are not edited.

NOTE This variable changed in 2020. For details, please see the errata entitled: 
 "Corrections from a review of CV_HRLY_COMPENSATION and CV_HRLY_PAY variables"
